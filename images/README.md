# Icon Placeholder

Since we can't generate actual PNG images, please replace `images/icon.png` with a 128x128 pixel icon for your theme.

You can create an icon using:
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva
- AI image generators
- Simple graphics editors

The icon should be:
- 128x128 pixels
- PNG format
- Clear and recognizable
- Related to your theme concept

For now, the package.json references `images/icon.png` - you'll need to add this file manually.
